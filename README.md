# question_generation

This project focuses on question generation, likely based on a dataset similar to SQuAD. The architecture is research-oriented, emphasizing experimentation and flexibility.

The development plan focuses on recreating a simplified version of the project, prioritizing core functionality like data loading, basic question generation, and evaluation, before adding more advanced features.

## Modules

*   `data_loader.py`: Loads the dataset.
*   `rule_based_question_generator.py`: Generates questions based on rules.
*   `evaluation.py`: Calculates BLEU score to evaluate generated questions.
